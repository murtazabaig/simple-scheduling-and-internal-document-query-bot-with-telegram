  "description": "Template Overview This workflow demonstrates how to build a simple Telegram botthat can schedule events, check service prices, and query company documentsusing AI integrated with MCP and RAG. It’s designed to show how n8n can connectconversational interfaces with internal tools in a clear and scalable way.Key Concepts (explained simply):MCP (Multi‑Channel Processing): A framework that lets the AI agent connect toexternal services (like Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets) through MCP Clients andServers. Think of it as the “bridge” between the bot and your tools.RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation): A method where the AI retrievesinformation from documents before generating a response. This ensures answersare accurate and based on your actual data, not just the AI’s memory.⚙️ Setup Instructions (step‑by‑step)Create a Telegram BotUse BotFather to generate a bot and get the API token.Configure Google ServicesMake sure you have access to Google Calendar, Docs, and Sheets.Connect them via MCP Server so the agent can call these tools.Set up Redis MemoryCreate an Upstash Redis account.Configure it in the workflow to store conversation history.Import the Template into n8nLoad the workflow and update credentials (Telegram, Google, Redis).Test the BotSend a message like “Schedule laptop maintenance tomorrow” and check if itcreates an event in Google Calendar.🛠 Troubleshooting SectionBot not responding?Verify your Telegram API token is correct.Google services not working?Check that your MCP Server is running and properly connected to Calendar, Docs,and Sheets.Conversation context lost?Ensure Redis memory is configured and accessible.Wrong date/time?Confirm that relative dates (“tomorrow”, “next week”) are being converted intoISO format correctly.Customization ExamplesThis template is flexible and can be adapted to different scenarios. Here aresome ideas:Change the communication channel Replace the Telegram Trigger with WhatsApp,Slack, or a Webhook to fit your preferred platform.Expand document sources Connect additional Google Docs or Sheets, or integratewith other storage (e.g., Notion, Confluence, or internal databases) to broadenthe bot’s knowledge base.Add new services Extend the workflow to handle more requests, such as bookingmeeting rooms, checking inventory, or creating support tickets.Personalize responses Customize the AI Agent’s tone and style to match yourcompany’s branding (formal, friendly, or technical).Segment agents by role Create specialized agents (e.g., one for scheduling, onefor pricing, one for troubleshooting) to keep the workflow modular and scalable.Integrate external APIs Connect to services like Google Calendar, CRM systems,or helpdesk platforms to automate more complex tasks.",
